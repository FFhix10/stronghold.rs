# Synchronization

Synchronization inside Stronghold makes it possible to port snapshots to other running instances, locally or remote

## Types of Synchronization

We distinct between local synchronization, where the target snapshots will be retrievable locally, and remote synchronization where we provide a protocol for secure secrets exchange. Both will be explained in more detail, and examples are given where apropriate. 

## Local Synchronization



```lang: rust
```


## Remote Synchroniation


```lang:rust
```
