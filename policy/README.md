# Stronghold Policy Engine

A dynamic policy engine for stronghold. A policy consists of a context for which a mapping for an inner type is present. This deviates a bit from a pure policy engine implementation, but enables the user to create a more lose coupling across remote peers. In Stronghold parlance a context may represent a peer id that is mapped to an arbitrary client id, and each client (eg. a client actor with a state) has some fine grained access control that can be checked with the policy engine.
